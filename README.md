# Node-API-Express

#### To run use following commands:
- npm install
- cd api
- node index.js


This is an API built with node js and express. All information is saved in a json file.
On the start page you can see all the planets in our solar system, to delete a planet from
the file you push the delete button for that planet. If you want to create/ delete or update a planet go to New planet.

Under **Nasa API** in the navbar i use an external API to fetch images of the planets. Press the different buttons to see the images.
